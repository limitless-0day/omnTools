# omnTools

A custom command-line tool that can be freely extended as needed.

## Deploy

Enter on the command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/limitless-0day/omnTools.git
```

Go to the project directory and compileï¼š

```shell
cd omnTools
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

If you're new to CMake or you want to avoid using commands, you can run `build.bat`.

```shell
cd omnTools
build.bat
```

## Usage

You can add the resulting executable to your computer's environment variables, which can then be easily used on the command line. Note: For ease of use, it is recommended that you change the name of the generated executable file to omn.exe.

Here are some basic usages, but if you'd like to learn more, head over: https://omn.agsn.site.

```shell
omn model mkdocs #Generate a MkDocs template.
omn tip git #Print a collection of commonly used git commands.
```
